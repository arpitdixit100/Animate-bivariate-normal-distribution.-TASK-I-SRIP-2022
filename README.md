# Animate-bivariate-normal-distribution.



Reproduce the above figure showing samples from bivariate normal with marginal PDFs from scratch using JAX and matplotlib.
Add interactivity to the figure by adding sliders with ipywidgets. You should be able to vary the parameters of bivariate normal distribution (mean and covariance matrix) using ipywidgets.
